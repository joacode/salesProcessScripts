# sales Process Script
Repository of files to speed up sales processes

As I needed to speed up the process of billing, I coded some lines that, pasted in the console, returned me a summary of the products and the sales price. 

The 'sales left' are a reference to those which have more than one product, that are unreadable for the code.

I also had to record shipping data's from each sale. To speed up this process, I made other lines of code which let me look for the shipping's data and costs all over the page.

When someone doesn't want the product, they can make a devolution and this product is delivered to us. The way I have to control the sales that are already delivered it is by adding a note with 'nc hecha' or 'no facturada'.

The code pasted in the console let me find the ones which don't have the note with 'nc hecha' or 'no facturada', returning the username (so I can easily find the sale and add the note to it) and the price with the amount of units bought.

The '- check manually' are a reference to those which have more than one product, that are unreadable for the code.
