# sales Process Script
Repository of files to speed up sales processes

As I needed to speed up the process of billing, I coded some lines that, pasted in the console, returned me a summary of the products and the sales price.

I also had to record shipping data's from each sale. To speed up this process, I made other lines of code which let me look for the shipping's data and costs all over the page.
